Descriptions: 
1. Animal Kingdom Hierarchy:
Represents animals in a kingdom using Python with classes for common behaviors (Animal), specific categories (Mammal, Bird, Fish), and individual animals (Dog, Eagle, Flying_Fish).
Polymorphism is demonstrated through uniform method calls.
Users can create instances of different animals and perform actions like eating, sleeping, barking, flying, and swimming.

2. Geometric Shapes Calculation:
Calculates area and perimeter of geometric shapes in Python with classes for common properties (Shape) and specific shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle).
Polymorphism is demonstrated through iteration over a list of shapes.
Users can create instances of different shapes and calculate their area and perimeter.

3. Library Management System:
Implements a Library Management System in Python with classes for library items (books, DVDs, journals) and a catalog to manage them.
Users can perform operations like adding, searching, borrowing, and returning items from the library catalog.
